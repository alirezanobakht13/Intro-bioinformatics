        "### Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to an exploratory journey into the world of bioinformatics, where we will delve into the DNA of flying species. This project presents a unique opportunity to unravel a genomic mystery using Galaxy, a sophisticated yet user-friendly bioinformatics platform. Your mission is to assemble a genome from short-read sequences, revealing insights into a specific DNA sequence found in various avian species. Along the way, you'll learn to navigate the complexities of genome assembly and conduct detailed BLAST searches, piecing together a puzzle millions of years in the making.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objectives and Workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Introduction and Setup with Galaxy:**\n",
        "   - Start by exploring the Galaxy platform, designed for bioinformatics analysis. You can find a comprehensive introduction and a step-by-step guide on how to use Galaxy, including how to set up your work environment and get data into Galaxy, at the [Galaxy Project Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/). This resource provides a hands-on introduction to Genomics and Galaxy, covering basic aspects like creating a new history and using the Get Data toolbox.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Genome Assembly:**\n",
        "   - For learning about genome assembly methods, the [Galaxy Project Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) offers a variety of resources and guides. This site provides access to a wide range of learning materials, helping users to understand the intricacies of genome assembly within the Galaxy platform.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Performing BLAST Searches:**\n",
        "   - To understand how to perform BLAST searches using Galaxy, the NCBI BLAST User Guide remains a crucial resource. You can access it at [NCBI's BLAST User Guide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279690/). This guide offers detailed instructions and insights into using BLAST for sequence comparison and analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Comparative Genomics and Analysis:**\n",
        "   - Compare your findings against existing genomic data. This comparative analysis will help you shed light on the unique aspects of your assembled sequence and its significance in avian genetics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Specific Deliverables\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Complete Code:** Submit all the code you used for assembling the genome, performing BLAST searches, and further analysis. Ensure your code is well-commented and organized for clarity.\n",
        "- **Assembled Genome Fasta File:** Provide the fasta file of the assembled genome. This should be the direct output of your assembly process.\n",
        "- **BLAST Results CSV File:** Include a CSV file with the results from your BLAST searches. This file should contain detailed information about any genomic matches found.\n",
        "- **Detailed Interpretation:** At the end of your notebook, include a thorough interpretation of your findings. Discuss the significance of the sequence within the avian genome, any similarities or differences with sequences in other species, and the potential implications of these results. Your interpretation should be grounded in the data analysis conducted."
