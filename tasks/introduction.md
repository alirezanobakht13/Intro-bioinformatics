## Important Note on Project Deadline

Please be aware that the deadline for this project is set for the **16th of Bahman**. Due to the time constraints associated with grading and releasing the final grades, this deadline is firm and will not be extended. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in adhering to this timeline.

### Project Introduction

In this project, you will explore the intriguing world of bird genetics and their evolutionary trajectories. You will have the opportunity to apply bioinformatics methods to real biological questions, focusing especially on unraveling the genetic mysteries and evolutionary relationships of various bird species. To begin, you can access all the project materials in the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/IntroductiontoBioinformaticsFall2023/intro-to-bio-sut-final-project).

### Project Tasks

For specific project tasks, please refer to the README in the GitHub repository.

### Methodology and Freedom of Exploration

Throughout these tasks, you are encouraged to use a diverse array of bioinformatics tools and techniques. The aim is to encourage creativity, enhance problem-solving skills, and ensure the practical application of theoretical knowledge.

## Grading and Bonus Structure

### Overview

The grading system for this project is designed to recognize and reward thoroughness, creativity, and adherence to best practices. Each task includes embedded bonus opportunities, and we will also acknowledge any additional depth or analysis that goes beyond the specified task descriptions.

### Base Points

- Your project starts with a base score of 4 points.

### Task Weights

The tasks for this project have been assigned the following weights:

- **Find The Imposter - Deciphering Mysterious Sequences**: 1.0
- **Comparative Analysis of Mitochondrial Genomes**: 1.0
- **Neural and Immunological Responses of Zebra Finches**: 1.5
- **A Single-Cell Perspective on Gene Expression**: 0.5

To achieve the full mark for a task, it is sufficient to complete the notebooks as specified in each task.

**Important Note on Grading for "A Single-Cell Perspective on Gene Expression"**:

Please note that the task "A Single-Cell Perspective on Gene Expression" has a cut-off of 50 marks. This means if you score less than 50, your score for this task will be 0. This policy is in place to ensure that the submissions reflect a genuine effort and are not merely reproductions of the ChatGPT response generated from the task description. To be eligible for grading for this task, it is necessary to enhance your prompt engineering skills and contribute a significant portion of the work yourself.

### Multiplicative Bonus Factors

- **Clean Coding**: We strongly encourage clean, modular code with reusable components. Well-written and well-documented code will result in a 1.1x multiplier being applied to the task's grade.
- **Git Best Practices**: Effective use of Git, including committing regularly with clear commit messages, will result in a 1.1x multiplier being applied to the task's grade.

### Soft-Cap Bonus

- You can earn an additional 1.5 points by completing bonus activities associated with each task or by meeting other bonus criteria. This can increase your total to a maximum of 5.5 points.

### Extended Bonus Opportunity

- If you aim to achieve more than 5.5 points, there is the possibility to earn an additional point. This is a challenging goal and does not include standard bonuses such as clean coding. This extra point is awarded for exceptional effort, adding substantial educational value, and for excellent documentation of your work.

### Task-Specific Bonus

- While each task may have its own bonus activities, you are not limited to these. The course is designed to provide you with practical experience, so you are encouraged to extend your notebooks creatively. This could involve delving deeper into a topic or broadening the scope of your study.
- We have not established strict rules for bonus points for each task, as there are numerous ways you might enrich them. You can make your task more comprehensive or more intricate. We understand that this may seem vague, but it is challenging to have a fixed rule for every possible extension you might conceive.
- If you engage in additional work that you believe merits a bonus, please document it in a dedicated section of your report. Describe what you did, its value, and what you learned. Also include any other pertinent information.
- You have the freedom to expand almost all tasks in various ways. Whether you choose to cover additional topics or delve deeper into one area, ensure you document your work thoroughly. Discuss why you added certain sections, your approach, your results, and your reflections on what was successful or not.

### Project Delivery Information

As part of the course requirements, you will be required to deliver your final project presentation. The specifics regarding the delivery method, whether online or in-person, will be announced at a later date.

## Deliverables

Your GitHub repository will serve as the main mechanism for delivering your project. It should contain all necessary files and documents related to your project tasks. If your project includes large files, please upload these to a suitable hosting service and include a direct link in your repository.

For tasks involving a notebook, the notebook itself will serve as both the code and the report. For other tasks, a separate report will be necessary. Additionally, if you undertake any bonus activities or use extra tools or websites for a task, you should write an additional report to cover these aspects.

Any extra work, such as bonus activities, should be clearly highlighted in your reports. Likewise, if you employ additional tools or resources in any of your tasks, you must specify which tools were used and describe the steps taken in your report.

Remember, the objective is not only to complete the tasks but also todocument your process, your learnings, and your achievements comprehensively. Good luck!
