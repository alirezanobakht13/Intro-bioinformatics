        "This task focuses on the comparative analysis of mitochondrial genomes from different species, primarily birds, mammals, and insects. The aim is to understand the evolutionary relationships between these species by analyzing and comparing their mitochondrial DNA, which is about 16,000 base pairs in length. You will use advanced computational methods to construct phylogenetic trees and delve into the ecological and anthropological insights that can be gleaned from this data. This project is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of mitochondrial genomics, its importance in evolutionary biology, and its applications in broader scientific contexts.\n",

        "- **Sequence Labeling**: Properly label each sequence within the FASTA file. This header, starting with '>', should include the species name and any other relevant information (e.g., `>Eudynamys_scolopaceus_NC_060520`). This is crucial for identifying the sequences in subsequent analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Concatenate Sequences**:\n",
        "    - Create a script to concatenate all downloaded sequences into a single `.fasta` or `.fna` file.\n",
        "    - Ensure each sequence in the file is clearly separated by its header line, which is important for differentiating the sequences of various species.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Tips for Writing the Download and Concatenation Script:\n",
        "- Use Python libraries such as `httpx` or `requests`, or any other tool you prefer for downloading sequences. For processing FASTA files you can use a wide range of tools. One recommended option is `Biopython` library.\n",
        "- Use a loop to go through each link in the dataset, download the sequence, and append it to your concatenated file.\n",

        "As we conclude our exploration of phylogenetic tree construction and analysis, let's reflect on the insights learned from this task and consider questions that emerge from our findings.\n",

        "#### Interpretation of Results:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Reflect on the phylogenetic trees produced by each method (Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood, and neighbor-joining). Consider how the differences in tree topology might offer varied perspectives on the evolutionary relationships among the species.\n",

        "#### Questions to Ponder:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Species Divergence**: Based on the trees, which species appear to have the most ancient divergence? How might this information contribute to our understanding of their evolutionary history?\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Common Ancestors**: Are there any unexpected pairings or groupings of species that suggest a closer evolutionary relationship than previously thought? How could this reshape our understanding of these species' evolutionary paths?\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Methodology Insights**: Considering the discrepancies between the trees generated by different methods, what might this tell us about the limitations and strengths of each phylogenetic analysis method?\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Conservation Implications**: Considering the evolutionary relationships revealed in your phylogenetic analysis, what insights can be gained for conservation strategies? Specifically, how could understanding the close evolutionary ties between species, which might be facing distinct environmental challenges, guide targeted conservation efforts?\n",
