### Task Design: Unveiling the Shortcomings of RNA-Seq Through Gene Expression Analysis and the Advantages of Single-Cell Techniques

#### Introduction

In this task, you are invited to design a project that highlights the limitations of traditional RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) in gene expression analysis and demonstrates the effectiveness of single-cell analysis. Your task will involve conceptualizing a research study focusing on insects, flies, birds, or bats, where RNA-Seq fails to capture crucial biological insights that single-cell techniques can reveal.

#### Objective

Your primary objective is to design a research project that:

1. **Identifies a Biological Phenomenon**: Choose a biological process or phenomenon in insects, flies, birds, or bats where gene expression analysis is crucial.

2. **Explores RNA-Seq Shortcomings**: Outline how standard RNA-Seq might fall short in capturing the nuances of gene expression related to this phenomenon.

3. **Demonstrates Single-Cell Analysis Strengths**: Illustrate how single-cell sequencing techniques can overcome these shortcomings and provide deeper insights.

#### Task Requirements

1. **Research Topic Selection**: Select a topic within the specified groups of organisms (insects, flies, birds, bats) that presents an interesting case for gene expression analysis.

2. **Background Research**: Conduct a literature review to understand the typical applications of RNA-Seq and single-cell analysis in your chosen topic.

3. **Methodology Design**: Propose a methodological approach for both RNA-Seq and single-cell analysis, highlighting the key steps where the latter offers more significant insights.

4. **Data Identification**: Specify the exact datasets for both RNA-Seq and single-cell analysis. **This will be a major part of the grade**

5. **Analysis Plan**: Outline the analytical steps you would take to process and compare the data from both techniques.

6. **Expected Outcomes**: Discuss the potential findings and implications of your study, focusing on how single-cell analysis can provide a more detailed understanding.

#### Document Guidelines

- **Format**: Prepare your task as a concise yet comprehensive document.
- **Structure**: Include sections like Introduction, Objective, Methodology, Data Sources, Analysis Plan, and Expected Outcomes.
- **Academic Tone**: Maintain a professional and academic tone throughout the document.
- **Clarity and Cohesion**: Ensure your task is logically structured and clearly articulated, with each section flowing smoothly into the next.
- **Creativity and Insight**: Be creative in your approach and provide insightful reasoning for your choices.

#### Submission

The final document should be in any format these tasks were presented to you. Ensure that you have done feasibility check for the task as it will be a major part of the total grade for it.
